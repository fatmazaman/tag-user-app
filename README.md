# TagUserApp

a simple Angular (latest) app that has this functionality:

- A list of comments
- A field that can allow people to add new comments
- The field should be able to detect when you type in someone's name starting with an @ like slack does.
- When the entry is entered it needs to detect which user was typed in and trigger a javascript function that alerts their name.

## Build
